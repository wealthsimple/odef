## Purpose

This is a template repository, it can be forked and customized to the needs of your organization. The repository provides the framework concepts and the adaptation is normally tailored based on the specific requirements. In some cases, there could be integration with ci/cd pipelines in other cases it can be used to only document and store security content and enable and promote knowledge sharing.

## Goals

1. The goal of the repository is to become a central security content knowledge management base where the content is stored, organized, shared, and interacted with.  
2. The goal of the python application is to assist with the process of detection documentation and can be extended to run unittests, quality checks, and more.
3. The repository also hosts the open detection engineering framework which can be used as a reference to tailor and craft internal processes accordingly.

## How to Install and Run the Project

* Use the template to create a new repository under your organization

* Clone it locally to your development machine

* Next, create virtual virtual environment

```bash
virtualenv venv 
```

Or if you don't use virtualenv

```bash
python3 -m venv {name of venv}
```

[More information on venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

* Activate your virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

* Then install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run the python app

```bash
python main.py
```

* Follow the process and once completed ensure that all files are present and your detection is well documented

### The Docker method

```
docker build -t odef .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/odef odef
```

The application will run in the container and your detections will be saved locally.
